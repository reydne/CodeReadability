In this repository are found some additional materials about the research.

## [Search string per engine (SS)](/AllPhasesMergedPapers-Part1.md)

Each search engine has its own form of advanced search, so the search string must be adjusted for each of the devices used in the review. Therefore, the search strings used in each machine are listed below.

* ACM:

          acmdlTitle :( "code comprehension" "code understandability" "code understanding" "code readability" "program comprehension" "program understandability" "program understanding" "program readability" "programmer experience" "readability") OR keywords .author.keyword :( "code comprehension" "code understandability" "code understanding" "code readability" "program comprehension" "program understandingability" "program understanding" "program readability" "programmer experience" "readability")

* IEEE:

## List of papers (LP)
In this directory, there is a list of all the papars found in each search engine. This directory is organized according to the exclusion phase and inclusion phase. The criteria evaluated in each phase are listed below.

* Study Exclusion
| ID | Description |
| EC1 | The paper is outside the scope of this study. It is not primarily related to source code comprehension, readability, or legibility, does not involve any comparison of different ways to write programs, neither direct nor indirect, or is clearly irrelevant to our research questions. For instance, we exclude studies focusing on high-level design, documentation, and dependencies (higher-level issues). |
| EC2 | The study is not a full paper (e.g. MSc dissertations, PhD theses, course completion monographs, short papers) or is not written in English. As a rule of thumb, we consider that full papers must be at least 5 pages long. |
| EC3 | The study is about readability metrics without an experimental evaluation. |
| EC4 | The study is about program comprehension aids, such as visualizations or other forms of analysis or sensory aids (e.g. graphs, trace-based execution, code summarization, specification mining, reverse engineering). |
| EC5 | The study focuses on accessibility, e.g., targets individuals with visual impairments or neurodiverse developers. |

## Study quality assessment questionnaire (QA)
In the quality assessment stage of primary studies included in the systematic review, we used a questionnaire as a guide. In this directory are found the questions used in this phase.

## Data extraction questionnaire (DE)
The data extraction step was also conducted through a questionnaire. In this directory are found the questions used in this phase.
